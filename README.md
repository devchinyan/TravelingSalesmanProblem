# Traveling Salesman Problem
#### Data: Malaysia LRT and MRT

#### Exact Search : End to End routing
> - With using graph data structure, construct a train graph
> - Using Breadth First Search to find minimum station required to travel from a random station to a random destination station

#### MetaHeuristic Search : Traveling Salesman Problem
> Given some random stations find the path with least station is used, to pass through all station and came back to original station   
> - Genetic Algorithm
> - Q Learning
> - Tabu Search
> - Simulated Annealing
> - Ant Colony Optimization (Swarm Intelligence)
> - Particle Swarm Optimization (Swarm Intelligence)

#### Setup
```bash
python3 -m virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter lab
```
